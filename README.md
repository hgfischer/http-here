# http-here

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hgfischer/http-here.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hgfischer/http-here)

`http-here` is a simple http server for testing, local development, and learning.

## Installing

Install the `go` compiler from your preferred source. I recommend the official packages from http://golang.org.

Once you have `go` installed, setup the environment variable `$GOPATH` to somewhere inside your `$HOME`. For example:

```
export GOPATH="/home/user/go"
mkdir -p $GOPATH
```

Then install `http-here` with the following command:

```
go get github.com/hgfischer/http-here
```

This will download, build, and install `http-here` to `$GOPATH/bin/http-here`.

For easy access, you can copy the `http-here` binary to `/usr/local/bin`, or somewhere else inside `$PATH`, or you
can add `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH` environment var.

## Usage

Currently there are a few options that you can check bellow or when running `http-here -h`:

```
Usage: ./http-here [flags]

Flags:
  -a=":8080": Address to start listening for HTTP connections
  -c=-1: Set cache time, in seconds, for cache-control max-age header
  -cors=false: Enable CORS via the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header
```
